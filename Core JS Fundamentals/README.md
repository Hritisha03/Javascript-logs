# Javascript-logs

Hey there!
This repo is my little corner of the internet where Iâ€™m learning JavaScript step-by-step. From baby steps like console.log("hello world") to building interactive stuff with the DOM â€” itâ€™s all going here.

Not perfect, not polished â€” just pure learning, trial & error, and a whole lotta debugging.

Stick around if youâ€™re on the same journey! ðŸ’»âœ¨
